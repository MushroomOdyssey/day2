All of the lessons learned from my 2nd day studying with The Odin Project!

Now that we’ve got the basic building blocks of a webpage, how do we actually use them?

The vast majority of webpages contain a whole lot of text and HTML provides a wide range of tags to structure, format, and give meaning to that text. These tags don’t just change the text's visual appearance; they also convey tone and context to assistive technologies like screen readers.

That’s why it’s important to keep HTML semantic. For example:

&lt;em&gt; and &lt;strong&gt; italicize and bold the text, respectively, that they encapsulate. But they also convey emphasis and importance to assistive technologies.

&lt;i&gt; and &lt;b&gt; are their purely visual equivalents, but we should really leave matters of style to CSS. A single stylesheet can handle formatting consistently across a whole webpage and even your whole website.

The takeway: HTML forms the structure, or skeleton, of your webpage. CSS makes it beautiful, and JavaScript brings it to life.

This approach keeps your HTML clean, maintainable, and accessible.

On Day 2 of my journey with The Odin Project, I’m moving beyond the boilerplate (Day 1 project <a href="https://mushroomodyssey.github.io/TOP_HTML_Boilerplate/">here</a>!) and into the tags that give structure and meaning to a page. Things are ramping up fast!
