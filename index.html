    <p>Today we I will explore a number of HTML elements that we use to add formatting and semantic meaning to our
        webpages.
    </p>
    <p>But before I get into all of this, let's define the word <b>semantic</b>. A quick dictionary search reveals the
        following definition: <i>relating to meaning in language or logic</i>. That's rather vague, isn't it? Let's
        explore
        that word a little more thoroughly so we can gain an appreciation of its impact in our lives and in our HTML.
    </p>
    <p>When I write the word "fluffy", and you read it, there's a lot that's actually happening in that interaction. You
        see a collection of symbols on a page that come together to represent a series of noises that we would make to
        each other if we were standing face-to-face. But... it's more than that, right? The word has a meaning outside
        of what we see and hear. It conveys something that we <em>feel</em>, that we <em>imagine</em>, even. All of
        those internal processes that instantly spring into action and present you with thoughts of furry animals, soft
        tactile sensations, and plump shapes provide the actual meaning to the word, as you perceive it.</p>
    <p>That's one of the reasons we have so many minor variations of a concept - think fluffy vs fuzzy vs floofy vs
        frizzy vs puffy, etc. I'd bet that if you had to generate a basic visualization of each of those words, they'd
        look extremely similar. Each word is more than just the shape you see, or the color, or the feel, or the way it
        moves in the breeze.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Now that brings us to HTML. So what are the semantics of a tag or an element? Does a browser need to ruminate on
        the deeper meaning of the &lt;strong&gt; element before interpreting the code?</p>
    <p>Well, no...</p>
    <p>But <em>we</em> do.</p>
    <p>For illustrative purposes let's start with the most obvious set of tags that require us to pay some extra
        attention to the semantics of our HTML:</p>
    <p>&lt;i&gt;, &lt;b&gt;, &lt;em&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;</p>
    <p>These are the <i>italics</i>, <b>bold</b>, <em>emphasis</em>, and <strong>strong</strong> tags.</p>
    <p>Visually, there is no difference between the <i>italics</i> and <em>emphasis</em> tags or the <b>bold</b> and
        <strong>strong</strong> tags.
    </p>
    <p>But as we know, there is more to meaning than what can be understood from any single dimension of perception. In
        fact, the &lt;i&gt; element can be used in a variety of ways that visually illustrate some minor degree of
        implied
        context, such as a tag line or motto, a quote from a reviewer, a subtitle to a book or movie, etc. This context
        only has meaning when perceived visually to the reader.</p>
    <p>The &lt;em&gt; element, however, holds a more conversational meaning. As the name of the element suggests, it
        bestows a
        <em>stressed emphasis</em> on any text that it encapsulates. The nature of what is implied by that emphasis
        relies on the
        context of the rest of the sentence or document. When used with assistive technology like a screen
        reader, it
        indicates a <em>stressed emphasis</em> on its content, either by generating a special set of braille indicator
        symbols around the text, or by adding the stressed vocal quality to some, but not most voice screen readers.
    </p>
    <p>And the difference between &lt;b&gt; and &lt;strong&gt; are very similar. <b>Bolded text</b> should be strictly
        used if you'd like to add a bit of formatting that acts as a visual support to the function of the content.</p>
    <p><strong>Strong text</strong>, on the other hand, should be used only to convey a sense of importance or urgency
        to a selection of text.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Those examples are fairly obvious, but what about the rest? &lt;p&gt; and &lt;div&gt; are pretty similar, but
        &lt;p&gt; adds an extra bit of space above and below it. What if I don't like that extra space? Can I just wrap
        all of my paragraphs in a &lt;div&gt; element?</p>
    <p>Or what about all of the different heading elements?
    <h1>&lt;h1&gt;</h1>
    <h2>&lt;h2&gt;</h2>
    <h3>&lt;h3&gt;</h3>
    <h4>&lt;h4&gt;</h4>
    <h5>&lt;h5&gt;</h5>
    <h6>&lt;h6&gt;</h6>
    Can't I just use &lt;h1&gt; and be done with it? How many different titles or headings could you have on a page?</p>
    <p>Nope, sorry. It's hard to explain without jumping too far ahead in the curriculum, but trust me when I say that
        as we get deeper into the content, you will begin to understand
        the power and control that semantic HTML provides over the look and feel of your webpage. This is something
        that I didn't fully appreciate the first time around but as I refactored my code over and over again, I began to
        see that many of my headaches were solved simply by incorporating semantic HTML into my work.</p>
